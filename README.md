# War Beast

War Beast is a game project.

*abstract*

In War Beast the last world war left earth in it's last breath. Driven by greed humans used everything they had to win, and that included nuclear weapons. Millions of people, animals and nature itself were turned to ashes and the planet would not survive for long but...
Amidist that chaos, an ancient being returned from it's slumber as the last chance to save the earth.


The elder Treant, the mind within nature, awakened The Tree of Life to use its powers as an attempt to survive and reestablish "life" as it was. But it was discovered that, not only the world was weak because of the nuclear war, but there was something else contributing for the end of earth. Some really strange animals or creatues were found lurking the wastelands, by no means they were something natural. We called it corruption, and it was spreading while the world was suffering and life would have to fight against it. For that purpose, the strongest reamaining animals were choosen and infused with the power of The Tree of Life to work as defenders of the nature, they were called War Beasts. And Thats where the players start, you are a War Beast fighting against the world corruption, trying to recover the lands lost by the war and trying to find out a way to free everything from corruption.
